My calculator has 4 functions, as indicated on the menu: arithmetic calculator, lb to kg converter, feet to meter converter, and BMI calculator. The lb to kg and feet to meter functions are for users who need their weight and height in kg and m for the BMI calculation or if they just want to convert it just for the sake of knowing. The only setback I faced was that I had to learn a bit of JavaScript. I am familiar with C++ and Python, and I found there wasnâ€™t much difference between them except syntax.
